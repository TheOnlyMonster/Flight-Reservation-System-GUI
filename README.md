# Flight Reservation System

## Project Description
This project is a Flight Reservation System developed using C# and WinForms, with a backend database implemented in SQL. It incorporates the concepts of the Observer design pattern, inheritance, and polymorphism, which were learned during the Database Systems-1 course at Cairo University, Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence, Information Systems Department.

The Flight Reservation System provides the following functionalities:

1. User Registration: Users can sign up as administrators or customers.
2. User Profile Management: Users can update their personal information.
3. Aircraft Management: Administrators can add new aircraft and update their details.
4. Flight Management: Administrators can add new flights and update their details.
5. Flight Search: Users can search for available flights based on specific criteria.
6. Flight Operations: Users can perform operations like booking, canceling, and changing flight class.

## Implementation Details
The project successfully implemented all the required deliverables, including:

1. System Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): The conceptual model of the system's database design. It includes at least 5 entities, including 1 many-to-many relationship.

2. Software Application: The Flight Reservation System has been implemented using C# and WinForms. The application provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system. The Observer design pattern has been utilized for efficient notification and updates.

3. Conceptual ERD: The graphical representation of the system's Entity Relationship Diagram. The ERD matches the conceptual model mentioned earlier.

4. Corresponding Physical ERD: The transformation of the Entity Relationship Diagram into the physical model. The physical ERD includes tables, attributes, primary keys, foreign keys, and additional constraints.

5. Implemented database on MS SQL Server: The database has been successfully implemented using MS SQL Server. It reflects the physical ERD and supports all required functionalities of the Flight Reservation System.
